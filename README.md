This project applied computer vision and mechine learning methods aimed to detect abnormal behaved object.

We focused on a privacy-preserving video and obtained the internal information of video with image processing techniques. Using optical flow features, we estimated and segmented inhomogeneous crowds composed of pedestrians that travel in different directions. With these features, we applied several classifying algorithms to tell the normal behaviour from the abnormal. In this process, we used grid search method to find the best hyper-parameter.
